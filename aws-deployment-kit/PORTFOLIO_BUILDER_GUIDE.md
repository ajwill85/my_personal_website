## 🆚 CloudFront URL vs Custom Domain

### Starting with CloudFront URL (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free - no domain purchase needed
- ✅ Fast setup - live in 15 minutes
- ✅ Perfect for testing and learning
- ✅ Can add custom domain later

**Cons:**
- ❌ URL is not memorable (e.g., `d123abc.cloudfront.net`)
- ❌ Less professional looking

**Best for:** Testing, learning, temporary sites

---

### Upgrading to Custom Domain (Optional)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional URL (e.g., `yourname.com`)
- ✅ Better for sharing and branding
- ✅ Looks more professional

**Cons:**
- ❌ Costs $10-15/year for domain
- ❌ Takes 30-40 minutes to set up (DNS propagation)
- ❌ Additional $0.50/month for Route 53

**Best for:** Professional portfolios, long-term sites

**You can start with CloudFront and upgrade later!**
