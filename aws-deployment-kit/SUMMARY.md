## 📋 Quick Start (For New Users)

### Test Deployment (No Domain)
```bash
# 1. Setup
cd aws-deployment-kit
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 2. Deploy infrastructure
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name test-website \
  --template-body file://cloudformation/website-infrastructure-no-domain.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=ProjectName,ParameterValue=test-website \
  --region us-east-1

# 3. Wait for completion (~12 min)
aws cloudformation wait stack-create-complete \
  --stack-name test-website \
  --region us-east-1

# 4. Get outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name test-website \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'

# 5. Deploy your site
npm run build
../aws-deployment-kit/scripts/deploy.sh <bucket> <distribution-id>
```

**Result:** Website live on CloudFront URL in ~15 minutes!
