# Issues Found During Testing - AWS Deployment Kit

**Test Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Tester:** Automated validation with profile=build  
**Test Scope:** End-to-end deployment without custom domain

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `deploy.sh` Script
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Documentation references `scripts/deploy.sh` throughout (README, GUIDE, QUICK_START, etc.)
- Script did not exist in the `scripts/` directory
- Bootstrap script creates a different version in project root, causing confusion

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/scripts/deploy.sh` with full functionality
- Includes proper error handling, AWS profile support, and colored output
- Made executable with proper permissions

**Location:** `/scripts/deploy.sh`

---

### 2. Missing `validate-stack.sh` Script
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Referenced in README.md and INDEX.md
- Bootstrap script creates it in project root, but not in scripts/ directory
- Inconsistent with documentation structure

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/scripts/validate-stack.sh` with CloudFormation validation
- Supports both template files (with and without domain)
- Includes AWS profile support and detailed output

**Location:** `/scripts/validate-stack.sh`

---

### 3. No Template for Testing Without Domain
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Main template requires domain name and creates Route 53 resources
- No easy way to test deployment without purchasing a domain
- Certificate validation requires DNS, blocking quick testing

**Fix Applied:**
- Created simplified template: `website-infrastructure-no-domain.yaml`
- Removes domain requirements, Route 53, and ACM certificate
- Uses CloudFront default certificate
- Perfect for testing and development

**Location:** `/cloudformation/website-infrastructure-no-domain.yaml`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified (Need Review)

### 4. Script Location Inconsistency
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS DECISION

**Problem:**
- Bootstrap script creates `deploy.sh` and `validate-stack.sh` in project root
- We created them in `scripts/` directory
- Documentation references both locations inconsistently

**Options:**
1. **Keep in scripts/**: Update bootstrap.sh to not create them
2. **Keep in root**: Move our scripts to root, update docs
3. **Support both**: Bootstrap creates symlinks or copies

**Recommendation:** Keep in `scripts/` directory for better organization

---

### 5. Bootstrap Script Creates Duplicate Scripts
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW

**Problem:**
- Lines 152-215 in `bootstrap.sh` create deploy.sh and validate-stack.sh
- These conflict with the scripts we created in scripts/ directory
- Could confuse users about which script to use

**Recommendation:** 
- Update bootstrap.sh to reference scripts/ directory instead of creating new files
- Or update it to create symlinks to scripts/ directory

---

### 6. Documentation Assumes Domain Usage
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS UPDATE

**Problem:**
- Most documentation assumes you have a custom domain
- Quick testing workflow not clearly documented
- No mention of the no-domain template option

**Recommendation:**
- Add section in QUICK_START.md for testing without domain
- Update README.md to mention both template options
- Add note about CloudFront URL usage for testing

---

## üìù Documentation Updates Needed

### Files to Update:

1. **README.md**
   - Add reference to `website-infrastructure-no-domain.yaml` template
   - Clarify script locations (scripts/ directory)
   - Add "Testing Without a Domain" section

2. **QUICK_START.md**
   - Add alternative path for testing without domain
   - Reference the no-domain template
   - Show CloudFront URL usage

3. **GUIDE.md**
   - Add optional domain section
   - Show both deployment paths (with/without domain)

4. **bootstrap.sh**
   - Remove script creation code (lines 152-215)
   - Reference existing scripts in scripts/ directory
   - Or create symlinks instead

5. **INDEX.md**
   - Update script references to scripts/ directory
   - Add no-domain template to file listing
