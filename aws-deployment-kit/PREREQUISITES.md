---

## üîí Step 5: Request SSL Certificate in ACM (10 minutes)

### Why Do This First?
- Certificate validation takes 5-30 minutes
- Must be done in `us-east-1` region for CloudFront
- Needs domain from Step 4 to be registered

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Region Must Be us-east-1

CloudFront requires certificates to be in `us-east-1` region!

### Instructions

1. **Switch to us-east-1 Region:**
   - In AWS Console, top-right corner
   - Click region dropdown
   - Select "US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1"
   - **Verify you're in us-east-1 before proceeding!**

2. **Open ACM Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm
   - Verify region shows "N. Virginia" (us-east-1)
   - Click "Request certificate"

3. **Request Public Certificate:**
   - Select "Request a public certificate"
   - Click "Next"

4. **Domain Names:**
   - Add your domain name: `yourdomain.com`
   - Click "Add another name to this certificate"
   - Add www subdomain: `www.yourdomain.com`
   - Click "Next"

5. **Validation Method:**
   - Select "DNS validation - recommended"
   - Click "Next"

6. **Key Algorithm:**
   - Leave as default (RSA 2048)
   - Click "Next"

7. **Tags (Optional):**
   - Add tags if desired (e.g., Name: My Website Certificate)
   - Click "Next"

8. **Review and Request:**
   - Review all details
   - Click "Request"

9. **Create DNS Records (IMPORTANT!):**
   - You'll see "Pending validation" status
   - Click "View certificate"
   - Under "Domains" section, you'll see CNAME records
   - Click "Create records in Route 53" button
   - Click "Create records"
   - Wait for confirmation

10. **Wait for Validation:**
    - Status will change from "Pending validation" to "Issued"
    - This takes 5-30 minutes
    - Refresh the page periodically
    - ‚òï Take a break!

### ‚úÖ Verification
- [ ] Certificate status shows "Issued" (not "Pending validation")
- [ ] Both domain names listed (yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com)
- [ ] Region is us-east-1
- [ ] DNS validation records created in Route 53

### üîç Troubleshooting

**Certificate Stuck on "Pending validation"?**
- Wait 30 minutes (it can be slow)
- Check Route 53 has the validation CNAME records
- Verify domain registration is complete
- Make sure you clicked "Create records in Route 53"

**Can't find "Create records in Route 53" button?**
- Your domain must be registered in Route 53
- You must be viewing the certificate details page
- Refresh the page and look under "Domains" section

## üìß Step 6: Verify Email in SES (5 minutes)

### Why Do This?
If you want to use the contact form feature (optional but recommended), you need to verify your email address in Amazon SES (Simple Email Service). This allows your website to send you contact form submissions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Region Must Be us-east-1

Use the same region as your certificate!

### Instructions

1. **Switch to us-east-1 Region:**
   - In AWS Console, top-right corner
   - Click region dropdown
   - Select "US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1"
   - **Verify you're in us-east-1!**

2. **Open SES Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses
   - Verify region shows "N. Virginia" (us-east-1)

3. **Navigate to Verified Identities:**
   - In left sidebar, click "Verified identities"
   - Click "Create identity"

4. **Create Email Identity:**
   - Identity type: Select "Email address"
   - Email address: Enter your email (e.g., `you@yourdomain.com` or `you@gmail.com`)
   - Click "Create identity"

5. **Check Your Email:**
   - AWS will send a verification email immediately
   - Subject: "Amazon Web Services - Email Address Verification Request"
   - Click the verification link in the email
   - **Must click within 24 hours!**

6. **Confirm Verification:**
   - Return to SES Console
   - Refresh the page
   - Your email should show "Verified" status

7. **Request Production Access (Optional):**
   - By default, SES is in "Sandbox mode" (can only send to verified emails)
   - For production contact forms, request production access:
     - Click "Account dashboard" in left sidebar
     - Click "Request production access"
     - Fill out the form (takes 24 hours for approval)
   - **For testing/demo:** Sandbox mode is fine!

### ‚úÖ Verification
- [ ] Email shows "Verified" status in SES Console
- [ ] Region is us-east-1
- [ ] Verification email received and clicked

### üí° Pro Tips

**Use Your Domain Email:**
- If your domain is `yourdomain.com`
- Verify `contact@yourdomain.com` or `hello@yourdomain.com`
- Looks more professional than Gmail

**Verify Multiple Emails:**
- Verify your personal email for testing
- Verify your domain email for production
- Both can be used

**Sandbox vs Production:**
- **Sandbox:** Can only send to verified emails (good for testing)
- **Production:** Can send to anyone (requires approval)
- **For demo:** Sandbox is sufficient!

### üîç Troubleshooting

**Didn't receive verification email?**
- Check spam folder
- Wait 5 minutes and check again
- Try a different email address
- Make sure email address is typed correctly

**Verification link expired?**
- Delete the identity in SES Console
- Create a new identity
- Click the link within 24 hours

**Need to send to unverified emails?**
- Request production access (takes 24 hours)
- Or verify recipient emails in sandbox mode
