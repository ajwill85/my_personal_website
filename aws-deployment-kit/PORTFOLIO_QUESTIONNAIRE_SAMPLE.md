## üíº Professional Summary

### About You (2-3 paragraphs)

Write a brief professional summary about yourself. What do you do? What's your expertise? What drives you?

**Your Summary:**  
```
I'm a Senior GRC Engineer with 10+ years of experience helping organizations build 
secure, compliant cloud infrastructures. I specialize in AWS security architecture, 
compliance automation, and risk management frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, 
and FedRAMP.

My passion lies in making security and compliance accessible and practical. I believe 
that effective GRC doesn't slow teams down‚Äîit empowers them to move faster with 
confidence. I've helped over 50 organizations achieve compliance certifications while 
reducing audit preparation time by an average of 60%.

I'm an active contributor to the cloud security community, speaking at conferences 
like AWS re:Invent and BSides, writing technical articles, and hosting the "GRC 
Engineering Podcast" where I interview industry leaders about practical approaches 
to governance, risk, and compliance in modern cloud environments.
